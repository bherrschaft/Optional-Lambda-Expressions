Once upon a time, there was a programmer who loved to solve problems using code.
Every day, they would write lines of code to create amazing software.
Their favorite language was Java, and they enjoyed learning new concepts and techniques.
Among their projects, they had a text processing program that could read and analyze text files.
The program could count lines, words, find the longest word, and even sort words alphabetically.
This made text processing an easy task, allowing them to focus on more complex challenges.
